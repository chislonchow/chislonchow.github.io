### How do I get started with psychotherapy directly from you?
You may reach me by email, sending me a few dates and times that work for you to schedule a meeting, so I can then reply with the next steps.

Prior to starting psychotherapy, I offer a one-time free 15 to 30 minute online video call. This intake consultation helps us determine together if you are a good fit for starting psychotherapy provided from me. 

Meetings typically will use online video call platforms. Clients are expected to have a stable internet connection and a device capable of video calling (such as a computer, tablet, or smartphone). Any special arrangements must be discussed and agreed upon in advance.

The typical psychotherapy session duration is 50 minutes for individuals. For family or couples therapy, the typical session duration is 1 hour and 15 minutes.

### What if I cannot afford the full cost of psychotherapy?
I strive to make psychotherapy accessible to those facing financial difficulties. I offer a limited number of sliding scale slots, which means that the session fee is adjusted based on your income and financial situation. If eligible, you may pay a reduced rate that is manageable for you.

Additionally, I partner with organizations that result in reduced rates for psychotherapy.

### What are the limitations of confidentiality?
Therapy sessions are confidential. However, there are legal and ethical exceptions where I am required to disclose information to a third-party without your consent. These include situations involving imminent harm, reportable abuse, or court orders mandating the release of information. These legal requirements are based on the laws of Ontario and Canada, not those of any laws of other jurisdictions or countries. 

For couples or family therapy, the entire group is considered the treatment unit. Therefore, I will encourage open and honest communication between participating clients, without forcing individual clients to share.

### Can you directly bill to my health insurance?

I am not currently set up to bill health insurance providers directly. I can provide you with a receipt that you can submit to your insurance company. However, it is your responsibility to confirm what services are covered and ensure that your insurance plan will reimburse you. 

### Are there any limitations to psychotherapy I should be aware of?
To maintain professional ethics, I avoid dual relationships or conflicts of interest with clients (such as social or peer relationships). This helps maintain the professionalism and objectivity of my psychotherapy service. 

I also typically practice within my scope of professional psychotherapy expertise, meaning I cannot proactively provide services related to legal proceedings, or other areas beyond my training. For this reason, I am also unable to provide medical diagnoses or medicinal treatments.
