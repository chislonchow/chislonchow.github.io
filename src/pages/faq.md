### How do I get started with psychotherapy directly from you?
You may reach me by email, sending me a few dates and times that work for you to schedule a meeting, so I can then reply with the next steps.

I offer a free 15 to 30 minute video call to help us determine if there is a good fit to proceed with receiving psychotherapy from me. 

Meetings typically will use online video call platforms. Clients are expected to have a stable internet connection and a device capable of video calling (such as a computer, tablet, or smartphone). Any special arrangements must be discussed and agreed upon in advance.

The typical psychotherapy session duration is 50 minutes for individuals. For family or couples therapy, the typical session duration is 1 hour and 15 minutes.

### What if I cannot afford the full cost of psychotherapy?
I strive to make psychotherapy accessible to those facing financial difficulties. I offer a limited number of sliding scale slots, which means the session fee is adjusted based on your income and financial situation. If eligible, you may pay a reduced rate that is manageable for you.

Additionally, I partner with organizations that provide partial subsidies for payment of sessions.

### What are the limitations of confidentiality?
Therapy sessions are confidential. However, there are legal and ethical exceptions where I am required to disclose information to a third-party without your consent. These include situations involving imminent harm, abuse, or court orders.

For couples or family therapy, the entire group is considered the treatment unit. Therefore, I will encourage open and honest communication between participating clients, without forcing individual clients to share.

### Are there any limitations to psychotherapy I should be aware of?
To maintain professional ethics, I avoid dual relationships or conflicts of interest with clients (such as social or peer relationships). This helps maintain the professionalism and objectivity of my psychotherapy service. 

I also typically practice within my scope of professional psychotherapy expertise, meaning I cannot proactively provide services related to legal proceedings, or other areas beyond my training. For this reason, I am also unable to provide medical diagnoses or medicinal treatments.
