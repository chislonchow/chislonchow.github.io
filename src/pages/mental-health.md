description: What is Mental Health
---

"[Positive mental health refers to] the capacity of each and all of us to feel, think, act in ways that enhance our ability to enjoy life and deal with the challenges we face. It is a positive sense of emotional and spiritual well-being that respects the importance of culture, equity, social justice, interconnections and personal dignity."

### Additional Perspectives on Mental Health
&#8203;
"The basic view of Taoism and Confucianism on mental health is to eliminate or transform individual desires, and the specific way to eliminate or transform individual desires is to promote the unity of man with nature or society."

"In North America, Indigenous peoples belonging to the Algonquian language family use the term mino-pimatisiwin, which could be loosely translated as "living the good life", to describe a state of harmony, well-being, and comprehensive health based on relationships, cultural identity, and connection to the land."

### Health According to Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT)

"The image of health offered by attachment science... is an individual who is balanced emotionally, mentally open, flexible in terms of action, deeply engaged and alive, and above all, able to learn and grow."

<sub> Johnson, S. M. (2019). _Attachment theory in practice: Emotionally focused therapy (EFT) with individuals, couples, and families._ Guilford Press.</sub>


"EFIT is an approach to growing and expanding the self and its capacities grounded in attachment science and the power of transforming core emotional experience. Core chaotic, foreign, or denied emotional experience is evoked, ordered, and regulated to shape emotional balance and integration in each client. Clients move from chaos to order, reactivity to balance, from self-abnegation to self-acceptance, from helplessness to agency."
