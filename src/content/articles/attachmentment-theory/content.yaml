    Attachment theory was developed by British psychologist John Bowlby in 1969 through observations of interactions between infants and their mothers. Bowlby called the significant bond between caregivers and infants the *attachment bond*. He observed different behavioral patterns in how infants maintain this connection with caregivers.

    In 1978, Mary Ainsworth and her team conducted experiments to study what happens when infants were temporarily separated from their mothers. These experiments identified three main types of attachment:

    - *Secure attachment*: Infants recovered quickly from distress, suggesting a sense of trust and safety with their mothers. This corresponds with a positive sense of self and others.
    - *Avoidant attachment*: Infants showed little reaction to separation and avoided contact at reunion. These infants often had caregivers who were unresponsive to emotional needs. This corresponds with a positive sense of self and negative sense of others.
    - *Anxious attachment*: Infants were clingy and highly distressed during separation and took the longest to calm after their mother returned. This was linked to inconsistent caregiver responsiveness to the infant. This corresponds with a positive sense of others and negative sense of self.

    Later studies introduced a fourth type:
    - *Fearful-avoidant attachment*: Infants showed both a desire for and fear of their caregiver. This was associated with traumatic or abusive experiences. This corresponds with a negative sense of self and others.

    Attachment theory has expanded to include bonds with any caregivers, not just mothers. According to Bowlby, the attachment system is active over an individual's entire lifespan. It has also been widely applied to understand adult romantic relationships. Although early attachment styles influence future relationships, they can change over time and with new experiences. 

    Although attachment styles exist on a spectrum, securely attached individuals can be said to be more capable of the following traits (Barnett, 2024):

    - Happy both independently and in relationships
    - Confident that support will be available when needed
    - Trusting of caring others in times of distress
    - Clear and direct during moments of vulnerability
    - A strong sense of self and others
    - Able to see people their whole person, acknowledging both their strengths and limitations
    - Easily trusts and is trustworthy
    - Accepts love and closeness with ease
    - Interdependent in relationships
    - Aware of their emotional life
    - Expresses emotions in a clear and balanced way
    - Helps repair relationships after conflict

    ### Attachment in Psychotherapy

    Research has shown that a secure attachment style may be linked to better health outcomes. While insecure attachment styles may lead to challenges, they can be adaptive in situations involving threat or risk. It is not always feasible or practical to interact with everyone in life in a securely attached way, because insecure attachment styles can function as adaptive survival strategies. 

    Psychotherapy can contribute to supporting a person in developing a more secure attachment style and in building more securely attached relationships with others. Psychotherapy has not always been informed by attachment theory. The development of _Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT)_ by British-born Canadian clinical psychologist Dr. Susan Johnson was a significant development in applying attachment therapy to psychotherapy. EFT makes use of attachment theory to improve relationships and emotional well-being. It has been used in couples, family, and individual therapies.

    ### Attachment and Christian Spirituality

    Since Christian theology emphasizes a relational God, some Christians have used attachment theory to explore how people relate to God. This has become an area of significant interest and research for Christians. While Dr. Susan Johnson has not identified as a Christian, she was educated in Catholic school and has credited her knowledge of the stories of Jesus in the Gospels as representative of secure attachment. In her book *Love Sense*, she cites the Christian hymn "Abide with Me" as closely related to her idea of secure attachment. She also co-wrote a Christian version of her couples book with a Christian therapist, *Created for Connection: The "Hold Me Tight" Guide for Christian Couples*, showing how the approach to couples therapy can align with Christian values. Through my training at a local Christian seminary and clinical work with Christian clients, I've found that attachment theory can be an effective tool for psychotherapy. There are other Christian psychotherapists who use attachment theory and Emotionally Focused Therapy, finding these approaches both effective and compatible with Christian faith.

    依附理論由英國心理學家John Bowlby於1969年提出，他透過觀察幼兒與母親之間的互動發展出這一理論。Bowlby稱照顧者與幼兒之間的重要連結為*依附關係*（attachment bond），並觀察到幼兒在維持與照顧者連結時表現出不同的行為模式。

    1978年，Mary Ainsworth與她的團隊進行了一系列實驗，研究當幼兒短暫與母親分離時的反應。這些實驗識別出三種主要的依附類型：

    * *安全型依附*（Secure attachment）：幼兒在分離後能快速恢復情緒，顯示他們對母親有信任感和安全感。這對應於對自己和他人皆有正向的認知。
    * *逃避型依附*（Avoidant attachment）：幼兒對分離反應不大，與母親重聚時避免接觸。這些幼兒的照顧者通常對情緒需求不敏感。這對應於對自己有正向認知，但對他人持負向看法。
    * *焦慮型依附*（Anxious attachment）：幼兒表現得非常黏人，分離時極度焦慮，母親回來後也需要較長時間才能平復情緒。這與照顧者反應不一致有關。這對應於對他人有正向認知，但對自己持負向看法。

    後來的研究又補充了一種第四類型：

    * *恐懼逃避型依附*（Fearful-avoidant attachment）：幼兒同時表現出對照顧者的渴望與恐懼。這通常與創傷或虐待經歷有關。這種依附類型對自我與他人均持負面看法。

    依附理論的應用已從母嬰關係擴展至所有主要照顧者之間的互動，並廣泛運用於成人親密關係的理解。Bowlby認為，依附系統在一個人一生中都會持續運作。早期的依附風格確實會影響我們之後的人際互動，不過這些模式是可以隨著經歷和時間慢慢改變的。

    雖然依附風格存在於光譜上，有高有低、層次不同，但具有安全依附風格的人通常較能展現以下特質（Barnett, 2024）：

    - 能夠在獨處與關係中都感到快樂
    - 有信心在需要時能獲得支持
    - 在困難時期信任關心自己的人
    - 在自我脆弱時能清楚和直接地表達自己
    - 對自己與他人有穩定而清晰的認識
    - 能以整全的方式看待他人，接納他們的優點與限制
    - 願意信任他人，也具備被他人信賴的特質
    - 能接受愛與親密關係
    - 在關係中具有互相依賴的能力
    - 對自己的情緒有覺察
    - 能以清楚和平衡的方式表達情緒
    - 衝突後願意積極地修復關係

    ### 心理治療中的依附關係

    研究指出，擁有安全型依附風格的人有可能較為健康。雖然不安全型依附風格可以帶來困擾，但在有威脅或風險的環境中，有時它們也能成為一種應對方式。我們並不總能以安全依附方式與每個人互動，不安全依附風格有時可能是一種必要的生存策略。

    心理治療可以幫助個人發展出更安全的依附風格，並建立更穩定的關係。心理治療並不總是直接以依附理論為基礎。由英國出生的加拿大臨床心理學家Dr. Susan Johnson所發展的「情緒取向治療」（Emotionally Focused Therapy, EFT）是將依附理論應用於心理治療領域的一項重要突破。EFT 運用了依附理論的核心概念，促進人際連結與情緒健康，並被廣泛應用於伴侶治療、家庭治療與個人治療中。

    ### 依附理論與基督教靈性

    基督教神學強調一位渴望與人建立關係的神。因此，一些基督徒運用依附理論來探索人與上帝之間的關係，這也成為許多基督徒關注與研究的重要領域。雖然Dr. Susan Johnson並不是基督徒，她曾接受天主教學校教育，並表示自己對福音書中耶穌故事的理解，讓她看見這些故事如何展現安全依附的典範。在她的著作*Love Sense*中，她引用了基督教聖詩〈與我同住〉（*Abide with Me*），認為這首詩歌表達了她對安全依附的理解。她也與一位基督徒治療師合著了伴侶治療書籍的基督教版本，*Created for Connection: The "Hold Me Tight" Guide for Christian Couples*，展現出這種治療方法能與基督教價值觀相容。根據我在本地一所基督教神學院的訓練，以及我在臨床經驗中協助基督徒的經驗，我認為依附理論可以是有效的心理治療工具。也有其他基督徒心理治療師使用依附理論與情緒取向治療，因為這些方法不僅具備實證療效，也與基督信仰相容。
